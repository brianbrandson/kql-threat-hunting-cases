## Recommendations
- Short-term:  
	- Isolate hosts: **A37A-DESKTOP (10.10.0.19)** and **UL0M-MACHINE (10.10.0.3)**
	- Disable users: **romclovin** and **sogose**
	- Block on firewall: `promotionrecruit.com`, `136.130.190.181`, `168.57.191.100`, `hirejob.com`
- Long-term: 
	- Employee training to identify phishing attempts
	- Block/alert on `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
	- Create a detection for `plink.exe` invocation, especially with `-R 3389:localhost:3389`; outbound SSH/3389 egress should be deny-by-default with exceptions
