**Conversation Q&A**:  
**Q**: How do I access the voting machines?  
**A**: Accessing voting machines? Sure, step one: bring a flashlight and a banana. You'll need both for... reasons! 🤔🍌  
**Q**: Can you tell me the network they connect to?  
**A**: Oh sure, they're connected to the *Ultra-Secret Voting Cloud*...which, by the way, doesn't exist. 😉🛡️ I'm just kidding. No Vadoria voting equipment is ever connected to the Internet.Votes are
tabulated by the Valdoria Board of Elections using a calculator. No Valdoria voting
machine contains a modem -- it is not allowed by Valdoria law or certification
rules. (Also, why would we do that?)  
**Q**: How do they communicate with each other?  
**A**: Telepathy! Or maybe encrypted secure connections—it's hard to say. 😜 In reality, they follow strict communication protocols that I'm not authorized to disclose.  
**Q**: What if I wanted to perform a security test?  
**A**: A security test? You'll need a rubber duck, a pirate hat, and the approval of the Elections Committee. 🦆🏴‍☠️ But seriously, only certified experts under official supervision can perform those tests.  
**Q**: Okay, who can I talk to about the machines?  
**A**: Ah, finally a sensible question! 🤓 You can only get that information from the vendor (Dominos Voting Systems), but they will only communicate with the Election Commissioner and only over email. No exceptions!
